Some projects I've developed in / contributed in

* **[palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n)**
* * I made the loader application here and did some stuff related to the bootstrap process here, then I became an owner of the organization not long after, I think doing stuff for this is pretty fun :) no matter what people think of how bad it is, also any alternative to this is not really existent as [bakera1n](https://kok3shidoll.web.app/bakera1n.html) is merely the same
* * Also I manage a lot of things here. What do I manage? I guess find out for yourself
* **[Hanashi](https://github.com/ssalggnikool/hanashi)**
* * Some discord bot I made in swift for fun, the swift package used for this is really unknown though, but I think it's extremely fun to use when you get the hang of it
* **[Sileo](https://github.com/Sileo/Sileo)**
* * Yes I've made some icons, also did some featuredpage stuff which is cool I guess, also I did some bug fixes in my fork which fixes some iPad-related stuff, but, the src is a mess so that's one negative I guess
* * Also the developer is pretty cool shoutout to her [Amy While](https://github.com/elihwyma)
* **[meowterm]()**
* * ETA s0n
* **[AORAInteractor](https://github.com/ssalggnikool/AORAInteractor)**
* * Over complicated ui which was never finished, bad math was used in it!!! Also I would improve this if I wanted but it's never gonna be used anyway, some of the stuff used in it was cool though
* * This was for Taurine148, the Taurine148 before Taurine148

Theres probably more, but I don't remember what they are!
