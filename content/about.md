hi I'm me `(she/her, they/them)`, i'm some designer and devloper I guess

Only knows english btw I don't speak alt key macos either

I did a lot of designs in the past and if you want me to (attempt) to make some icon or art you can pm `@ssalggnikool` on discord

I'm not that experienced in coding either I just do stuff for fun if I want to, hey at least I'm trying! Though, I do sometimes do bad practices so please point them out by at least making an issue abt it on GitHub

I mostly do UI design when coding but backend can also done as well if given enough effort, and I just know `swift` so please keep that in mind

I also designed a few icons and stuff for people in the past, you can find them at:
- [palera1n](https://palera.in) (Icon, other assets can be found [here](https://github.com/palera1n/website/tree/main/public/assets))
- [Sileo](https://github.com/Sileo/Sileo) (Alt Icons)
- [Antoine](https://chariz.com/get/antoine) (Icon)
- [AppIndex](https://chariz.com/get/appindex) (Banner)
- [Ding](https://chariz.com/buy/ding) (Icon / Banner)
- [Valery]() (Icon)
- [Parousia](https://havoc.app/package/parousia) (Icons / Banner) (on mobile!)
- - This was my first theme for iOS, check it out, it's not great but some people seem to like it, also it was all designed on mobile in a span of a week so props to me there I'm so good
- [r/Jailbreak](nope)
- - I made some icons for this including some of the wwdc ones and yea
- [r/Apple](https://reddit.com/r/Apple)
- - I made the iOS 17-inspired icon for this community one time, was used for awhile (you can see it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230628032109/https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/))

* [CodeEdit](https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit)
